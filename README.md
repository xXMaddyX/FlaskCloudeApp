## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Flask (Install via `pip install Flask`)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/xXMaddyX/FlaskCloudeApp.git
    cd FlaskCloudeApp
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```

3. Create a directory named `files` in the root directory. This will be the storage folder where files and directories are managed:

    ```bash
    mkdir files
    ```

4. Start the Flask server:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

   By default, the server runs on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.
